# Welcome to DeFi Spill

## WTF is this website

It's meant to collect the developing world of DeFi as soon as it happens, in a semi-organized place for people to browse. Most of the information on this website will be up to date, as I will change it every time I have a chance or I find something of interest on a project I follow. As such, you might find spelling mistakes, various typos, etc, but the information is as accurate as it can be and as fast as it can be.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Again, this website is meant to be updated as fast as possible. As such, it won't be as organized and polished as some might expect. If this bothers you, please ~~fuck off~~ go away, this is meant for degenerate farmers wanting the latest news and developments.
{% endhint %}

## Can I contribute?

Of fucking course! In fact, please do, I'm just one guy. [Here](https://github.com/patrick-jane-crypto/defi-spill) you can find the Github repo. Just submit a PR!
